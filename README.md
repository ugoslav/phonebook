In this project, I have used Vite and json-server. After cloning,make sure to run npm init to download all the dependencies.
One needs to open up two terminals; one for server and one for the frontend.
Run the server by the command "npm run server"
Run the site by the command "npm run dev"
Feel free to change the commands to your desire, by manipulating scripts in the package.json file.
